# Simon Nyssen

## Full-stack developer

Huy, Belgium | contact@snyssen.be

I am passionate about web technologies at large, be it for creating websites, managing infrastructures, or everything in between.
Most of my experience has been on the dotnet framework (especially ASP.NET) and Angular, but I am also proficient with other frameworks such as Astro and Preact.
As a full-stack dev, I also have experience managing infrastructure on both Windows and (preferably) Linux, databases (mostly SQL Server), and general DevOps (Agile, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployments).

<ResumeSection title="Work Experience">
### Full-stack developer | [Neuromedia](https://neuromedia.io/) | July 2019 - Current

Worked in a small team (less than 10 people, at most 3 developers) on a wide range of projects related to online media audience measurement.

| [CasterStats](https://www.casterstats.com) | high precision, real-time & large-scale BI solution for audience reporting specialized in IP radio & TV broadcasters, telcos & OTTs.

| Neuromedia Analytics | Rewrite of CasterStats, still in development. Brings a cleaner and easier to use interface as well as new features such as in-page player actions tracking and an even more plugin ready ecosystem that allows the easy implementation of custom metrics and dimensions, data sources, etc. | C#.NET - ASP.NET Core - Angular - SQL Server - RavenDB - Hangfire - DevExpress - MEF |
| CIM Dashboard | Custom made interface for the [CIM Radio Stream Monitor (RSM) study](https://www.cim.be/fr/radio). Interface makes use of the data provided by CasterStats. Made the migration from .NET 4.5 to .NET Core 3.1 then .NET 5 | C#.NET - ASP.NET Core - AngularJS - SQL Server |
| [OnFocus](http://www.onfocusphotographers.com/index.html) ingester | Desktop application that allows photographers of attraction parks (Marineland, Atonium, etc.) to propose digital versions of photos taken in an automated way. The photos are automatically ingested by the system, a QR code added, uploaded to a web server and printed. The QR code once used sends to an online page that allows to download the original or to buy frames, keychains and other objects with the photo. | C#.NET - .NET WPF - ZXing |

| Linux infra management | Infrastructure-as-code project for managing the newer Linux-based infrastructure of Neuromedia. An array of virtual machines reproducing the production environment can be deployed in one command for development and testing before the actual provisioning. | Ansible - Bash - Vagrant |
| Others | Also built a lot of smaller internal tools for managing configurations, deployments, integrating with 3rd party APIs, monitoring services, ingesting and cataloging data, etc. | C#.NET - Bash - Ansible - Vagrant |

### [Self-hosted infrastructure](https://github.com/snyssen/infra-snyssen.be)

Initially a simple collection of scripts for a manually managed server at home, this project as grown into a full blown personal infrastructure and my biggest pride as a tech person. The now 3 separate machines at my home provide a lot of the services I rely on daily, and are entirely provisioned using Ansible playbooks and container images.

#### Technologies and tools

Fedora Server - Ansible - Docker

### [Webb Launcher](https://git.snyssen.be/snyssen/webb-launcher)

A simple web start page built with Astro. Bundled as a container image, it can easily be self-hosted.

#### Technologies and tools

Astro - Preact - Drone CI - Docker
