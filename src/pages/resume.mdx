### Senior Software Engineer | [Neuromedia](https://neuromedia.io/) | January 2026 - Now

Working on media monitoring and analytics solutions

### Solution Integrator | [Gambit Finance](https://gambit-finance.com/) | July 2023 - January 2026

Managed Kubernetes and Openshift clusters, Azure and IBM clouds operations, and on clients' premises deployments

#### Achievements

- Managed clusters and applications monitoring using **FluentBit**, **Elasticsearch** and **Kibana** (EFK stack), as well as **Prometheus** (through Thanos) and **Grafana**. Also used **Dynatrace** for a bit
- Deployed applications using **Helm** on both **Kubernetes** and **Openshift** clusters
- Worked with clients to deploy customized solutions onto their own infrastructure, respecting their constraints while optimizing RoI for Gambit
- Helped with architecturing and deploying Gambit's SaaS offering on IBM Cloud

### Full-Stack Developer | [Neuromedia](https://neuromedia.io/) | July 2019 - July 2023

Worked with a small team on a wide range of projects related to online media audience measurement

#### Achievements

- Created a new **Angular** front-end in about 2 months, providing user-serviceable audience dashboards and internal administration tools for CasterStats, which enabled marketing team to showcase the product at [IBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Broadcasting_Convention) in September 2019 and attract a new influx of customers
- Migrated our legacy customer-tailored dashboard from **.NET 4** to **.NET 5 (Core)** in under a week, thus making sure we were ready to containerize and deploy the application on Linux as well as keeping current with the framework evolution
- Introduced company to [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) using **Ansible** and **Docker Compose** while migrating internal tools and databases from Windows to **Linux servers**, allowing for a more resilient and easier to scale and maintain infrastructure; **documented** the process so inexperienced coworkers could use the new tools themselves
- Lead **daily scrums** and **pair programming** sessions with interns in order to introduce them to the company's projects and tools, as well as help them produce MVPs that would eventually be deployed in production environments. Pushed for the employment of 2 of those talented interns over the years
- Rewrote company's [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipelines in **Bitbucket** and **Teamcity**, and managed deployment scripts in **Octopus**. Propagated builds and deployments information back into **Jira** so user stories could be tracked from inception to actual use

<ResumeSection title="Personal projects">

### [Mother of All Infra](https://github.com/snyssen/mother-of-all-infra)

My personal IaC codebase, it uses **Nix**, **Terraform**, **Ansible** and **Docker** to manage all of my machines (both servers and personal computers) and their config.
In particular, it allows me to self-host a complete personal cloud solution with:

- Various websites hosting, including [snyssen.be](https://snyssen.be)
- File, documents and calendar storage and handling
- Full multimedia management solution
- Smart home integrations
- Federated social networks and messaging platforms
- Automated backups of all devices and the servers themselves
- Identity management with SSO
- Secure networking with customized DNS management, mesh VPN integration, and dynamic firewalls
- Monitoring of the entire infrastructure
- etc.

This infrastructure provides services I rely on daily, and is a good way to safely experiment with server technologies before using them in a professional setting

### [Webb Launcher](https://github.com/snyssen/webb-launcher)

Self-hosted start page for the web, built with **Astro**

### [Nix Dev Environment](https://github.com/snyssen/nix-dev-env)
