<ResumeSection title="Work Experience">

### Full-stack developer | [Neuromedia](https://neuromedia.io/) | July 2019 - Current

Worked with a small team on a wide range of projects related to online media audience measurement

#### Achievements

- Created a new Angular front-end in about 2 months, providing user-serviceable audience dashboards and internal administration tools for CasterStats, which enabled marketing team to showcase the product at [IBC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Broadcasting_Convention) in September 2019 and attract a new influx of customers
- Migrated our legacy, customer-tailored dashboard from .NET 4 to .NET 5 in under a week, thus making sure we were ready to containerize and deploy the application on Linux as well as keeping current with the framework evolution
- Introduced company to [IaC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) using Ansible and Docker Compose while migrating internal tools and databases from Windows to Linux servers, allowing for a more resilient and easier to scale and maintain infrastructure. Documented the process so inexperienced coworkers could use the new tools themselves
- Lead daily scrums and pair programming sessions with interns in order to introduce them to the company's projects and tools, as well as help them produce MVPs that would eventually be deployed in production environments. Pushed for the employment of 2 of those talented interns over the years
- Rewrote company's [CI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration) pipelines in Bitbucket and Teamcity, and managed deployment scripts in Octopus. Propagated builds and deployments information back into Jira so user stories could be tracked from inception to actual use

### Student internship | [303% Media](https://303.media/#!home) | February 2019 - May 2019

Upgraded Traxflow, a platform bridging the gap between music producers and broadcasters

#### Achievements

- Fixed performance issues with the main background job of the application by implementing queries pagination and multithreading, cutting its average execution time significantly and preventing the server from crashing during large loads
- Learned and used the Ionic framework to produce a PoC of a Traxflow mobile app in less than a week
