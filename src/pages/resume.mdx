<ResumeSection title="Work Experience">

### Full-stack developer | [Neuromedia](https://neuromedia.io/) | July 2019 - Current

Worked in a small team on a wide range of projects related to online media audience measurement

#### Achievements

- Created a new Angular front-end in about 2 months, providing customized, user facing data dashboards, as well as internal administration tools for CasterStats. Enabled marketing team to showcase the product at IBC 2019, attracting a new influx of customers
- Migrated our legacy, custom made audience dashboard to .NET 5 under a constraining time window, thus making sure we were ready to later containerize and deploy the application on Linux
- Introduced company to infrastructure-as-code using Ansible and Docker Compose when tasked with migrating internal tools and databases from Windows to Linux servers, thus allowing for a more resilient and easier to upgrade and scale infrastructure

<ResumeSection title="Personal projects">
### [Self-hosted infrastructure](https://github.com/snyssen/infra-snyssen.be)

Initially a simple collection of scripts for a manually managed server at home, this project as grown into a full blown personal infrastructure and my biggest pride as a tech person. The now 3 separate machines at my home provide a lot of the services I rely on daily, and are entirely provisioned using Ansible playbooks and container images.

#### Technologies and tools

Fedora Server - Ansible - Docker

### [Webb Launcher](https://git.snyssen.be/snyssen/webb-launcher)

A simple web start page built with Astro. Bundled as a container image, it can easily be self-hosted.

#### Technologies and tools

Astro - Preact - Drone CI - Docker
