# Simon Nyssen

## Full-stack developer

Huy, Belgium | contact@snyssen.be

I am passionate about web technologies at large, be it for creating websites, managing infrastructures, or everything in between.
Most of my experience has been on the dotnet framework (especially ASP.NET) and Angular, but I am also proficient with other frameworks such as Astro and Preact.
As a full-stack dev, I also have experience managing infrastructure on both Windows and (preferably) Linux, databases (mostly SQL Server), and general DevOps (Agile, Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployments).

### [Self-hosted infrastructure](https://github.com/snyssen/infra-snyssen.be)

Initially a simple collection of scripts for a manually managed server at home, this project as grown into a full blown personal infrastructure and my biggest pride as a tech person. The now 3 separate machines at my home provide a lot of the services I rely on daily, and are entirely provisioned using Ansible playbooks and container images.

#### Technologies and tools

| Infrastructure |
| --- |
| Fedora Server |
| Ansible |
| Docker |

### [Webb Launcher](https://git.snyssen.be/snyssen/webb-launcher)

A simple web start page built with Astro. Bundled as a container image, it can easily be self-hosted.
